Act as a Senior Flutter Developer. I need you to help me scaffold and write the code for a "Vehicle Booking System" mobile application.

The backend is already built using PHP and MySQL. The app will communicate with the server via REST APIs.

### 1. Project Configuration
- **Framework:** Flutter (Latest SDK)
- **Language:** Dart
- **State Management:** Provider (or Riverpod, please recommend the best for this scope)
- **Networking:** Dio (preferred) or Http
- **Local Storage:** flutter_secure_storage (for saving JWT tokens)
- **UI Style:** Material 3

### 2. API Configuration
- **Base URL:** `http://10.0.2.2/vehicle_booking/api` (Use 10.0.2.2 for Android Emulator to access localhost)
- **Authentication:** Bearer Token. The token must be included in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

### 3. API Endpoints Reference
Here are the endpoints available on the server:

**Auth:**
- `POST /auth/login.php`
  - Body: `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
  - Response: `{ "success": true, "data": { "token": "...", "user": { ... } } }`
- `POST /auth/logout.php` (Requires Token)

**Vehicles:**
- `GET /vehicles/list.php` (Public)
  - Returns list of available vehicles with image URLs.
- `GET /vehicles/detail.php?id={id}` (Public)

**Bookings:**
- `GET /bookings/list.php` (Requires Token)
  - Returns list of user's bookings.
- `GET /bookings/view.php?id={id}` (Requires Token)
- `POST /bookings/create.php` (Requires Token)
  - Body: `{ "vehicle_id": 1, "from_datetime": "Y-m-d H:i", "to_datetime": "Y-m-d H:i", "pickup_location": "...", "drop_location": "...", "purpose": "..." }`

### 4. Required Screens & Features
Please generate the folder structure and the core code for the following:

1.  **Splash Screen:** Check if a token exists in secure storage. If yes, go to Dashboard; otherwise, go to Login.
2.  **Login Screen:** Email/Password form. On success, save token and user data, then navigate to Dashboard.
3.  **Dashboard (Home):**
    - Display a list of vehicles fetched from `/vehicles/list.php`.
    - Show vehicle image, name, capacity, and fuel type.
    - Tapping a vehicle goes to the Detail screen.
    - Sidebar (Drawer) for navigation (Home, My Bookings, Profile, Logout).
4.  **Vehicle Detail Screen:**
    - Show full details.
    - "Book Now" button that opens the Booking Form.
5.  **Booking Form Screen:**
    - Date/Time pickers for Start and End journey.
    - Text fields for Pickup, Drop, and Purpose.
    - Submit button calls `/bookings/create.php`.
6.  **My Bookings Screen:**
    - List previous and active bookings.
    - Show status badges (Pending, Approved, Rejected).

### 5. Specific Coding Requests
- Create a singleton `ApiService` class using Dio to handle interceptors (adding the token automatically).
- Create Data Models (`User`, `Vehicle`, `Booking`) with `fromJson` methods.
- Handle HTTP errors gracefully (e.g., show a SnackBar on 401 or 500 errors).
- Ensure the UI is clean and responsive.

Please start by outlining the folder structure and then provide the code for the `ApiService` and the `AuthProvider`.
